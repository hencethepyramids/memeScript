# memeScript

It starts by importing the necessary libraries, including requests for making HTTP requests, random for randomness, and webbrowser for opening a web page in the default web browser.

It defines the API URL as 'https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes' to request meme data from the "imgflip.com" API.

The script sends an HTTP GET request to the API using requests.get(api_url).

It checks the HTTP response status code to determine if the request was successful. If the status code is 200 (OK), it proceeds; otherwise, it prints a failure message.

If the request is successful, the script parses the JSON content of the response to extract meme data.

It then extracts the list of memes from the data.

If memes are found in the API response, the script randomly selects one meme from the list.

It retrieves the URL of the selected meme's image.

The script opens the meme's image URL in the default web browser using webbrowser.open_new_tab(meme_url).

Finally, it prints a message indicating that it has fetched and opened a random meme in the default web browser.

The script also includes comments reminding the user to handle exceptions, implement error handling, and customize it for specific use cases.
